# Campus-Network-Model-in-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
In this project, I designed a complete campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes multiple blocks with private networks: wireless devices, lab PCs, and faculty PCs each in separate subnets. Different networks were created for various university departments and institutes, with communication enabled between them.
